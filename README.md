### Introduction

In this documentation, we will explore the process of programming a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Sheets. We will discuss the steps involved in creating the website, including the challenges faced and the tests conducted during the development process.

### Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the web pages and defining the content.
- CSS: Used for styling the website and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing interactive features and functionality.
- Google Sheets: Used as a database to store information from contact me form.

### External Software/Code

- Google sheets app script from: https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets
- Icons from: https://fontawesome.com/

### Development Process

1. Planning: A simple portfolio website template. Sections: Home, about (3 subtabs), Services, Portfolio (Interactive w/ transitions), Contact (form to google sheet).
2. HTML Structure: Create the basic structure of the website using HTML tags. Divide the content into sections, such as an about me section, services section etc.
3. CSS Styling: Apply CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the website. Use CSS selectors and properties to customize fonts, colours, layouts, and animations.
4. JavaScript Functionality: Add interactivity to the website using JavaScript. Implement features such as smooth scrolling, image sliders, and form validation.
5. Integration with Google Sheets: Connect the website to Google Sheets to dynamically fetch and display portfolio content. Utilize the Google Sheets API to store data from the contact me form. (Program from GitHub above).
6. Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the website functions as expected. Test the responsiveness of different devices (phone vs computer), user experience (function as intended) and ensure contact me form sends relevant data to google sheets and resets.
7. Troubleshooting and Debugging: Debug any issues or errors encountered during the development process such as mistakenly using colon instead of semicolon in CSS or using incorrect id links in CSS. 

### Challenges Faced

During the development of the personal portfolio website, several challenges were encountered:

- Responsive Design: Ensuring the website looks and functions well on various screen sizes and devices.
- Data Integration: Integrating Google Sheets as a data source and retrieving content dynamically.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring the website works consistently across different web browsers.
- User Experience: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation.
